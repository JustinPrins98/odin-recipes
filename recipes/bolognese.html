        <h2>Mom's Spaghetti Bolognese</h2>
        <p>Recipe passed on from my Italian grandfather. The ultimate comfort food. Leftovers freeze nicely! To make
            this
            recipe more authentic, you can use a mixture of ground veal, pork, and beef. You can also substitute the
            balsamic vinegar for 1/2 cup of red wine.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>spaghetti</li>
            <li>olive oil</li>
            <li>bacon</li>
            <li>onion</li>
            <li>celery</li>
            <li>carrot</li>
            <li>oregano</li>
            <li>garlic</li>
            <li>beef</li>
            <li>vinegar</li>
            <li>tomatoes</li>
            <li>tomato paste</li>
            <li>white sugar</li>
            <li>salt and ground black pepper</li>
            <li>basil</li>
            <li>Parmesan cheese</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a rolling boil. Cook the spaghetti in the boiling water
                until
                cooked through yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes; drain.</li>
            <li>Heat the olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Cook the bacon in the oil until crisp, 8 to 10
                minutes.
                Stir the onion, celery, carrot, and oregano into the bacon; continue cooking until the vegetables begin
                to
                soften, another 8 to 10 minutes. Add the garlic and cook until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Crumble the
                ground
                beef into the vegetable mixture; cook and stir until the beef is completely cooked and no longer pink, 8
                to
                10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Pour the balsamic vinegar over the ground beef mixture; allow to simmer until the liquid evaporates,
                about 5
                minutes. Stir the crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, and sugar into the ground beef mixture; bring the
                mixture
                to a boil, season with salt and black pepper, and remove from heat. Stir the fresh basil into the
                mixture.
            </li>
            <li>Ladle the sauce over the cooked spaghetti. Top with Parmesan cheese to serve.</li>
        </ol>
